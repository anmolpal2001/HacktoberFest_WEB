## How to make a pull request? (for first timers - beginners)

Contributing for the first time? I got you 😀

- `Fork` the repo. (a copy of this repo will be made on your account).



- Write what you want in the proper file.<br/><br/>
    Two ways to write: <br/>
  - Clone the repo or download the zip folder and write into it. (download the code)
  - Press dot on the main page of the forked repository on your account, `VS Code Web` will open and then write into it.<br/><br/>
- Once you are done writing, add the necessary files with `➕ button` in github or use `git add --all`.<br/><br/>
- Then commit the files using the `✔ button` in vs code or use command `git commit -m "message"` command where in `message`, you will write a message about whatever you added.<br/><br/>



- Go to the main page of your forked repo on your account. You will see a `Compare And Pull Request` button. Click that.



- Go to `Pull requests` tab if you dont see the button mentioned.



- You will be redirected to the pull requests tab of this repo. Add a title for your pull request and a little description.

## Things to note ✏:

- Make sure you dont change some one else's added commits.
- Be respectful and make sure you dont add any offensive content.
- Do write a brief `description` and proper `title` for your pull request.
